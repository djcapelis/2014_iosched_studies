This is a skeleton of an XCode project that compiles nicely for a jailbroken iPhone using a modified version of XCode that doesn't require certificates.  (JailCoder is a simple point and click way to set XCode up to do this, if needed.)  You can find the test code in test/test/main.m and it is pretty much a hollowed out XCode app that just directly goes into C code and runs cache tests, ignoring everything else.  You can then copy the binary to a jailbroken iphone and run it at will.  Simply modify main.m to specify which tests you want to run.  Unlike some versions of the Linux version of these tests, the iOS version uses pthread_create() instead of fork(), as the latter is both extremely slow and causes problems on iOS.

A compiled binary that can be run on a device is available in test/build/Debug-iphoneos/test.app/test.
